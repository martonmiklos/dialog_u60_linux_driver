The U50 Module is a network driver for Linux that is used to communicate 
with the Echelon U60 and U50 network interfaces.  This document only 
refers to the U60 driver and the U60 network interface since the U60 
replaced the U50.

The U60 driver creates a Linux network device that can be used to send 
and receive classic LON and LonTalk/IP packets using a U60 network 
interface.  The U60 network interface can be configured to operate in 
Layer 2 or Layer 5 protocol processing mode, where the Layer number 
specifies the highest layer of the ISO/IEC 14908-1 protocol processed 
by the U60 network interface.  The LonTalk Device Stack EX included with 
the IzoT Router and with the IzoT SDK implements Layers 3 to 6 of the 
ISO/IEC 14908-1 Control Network Protocol with LonTalk/IP extensions.  As 
a result, the Layer 2 protocol processing mode is required to use the U60 
network interface with the LonTalk Device Stack EX.  Existing applications 
developed for other network interfaces such as the Echelon MIP or U10 
network interface typically use a Layer 5 interface where the network 
interface implements Layers 1 through 5 of the ISO/IEC 14908-1 protocol.  
When used in Layer 5 mode, the U60 network interface provides an interface 
that is compatible with the interface provided by other LON network 
interfaces such as the MIP and U10.

The U60 driver is included with the Echelon IzoT Router, and it is also 
available as source code for porting to other platforms.  The U60 driver 
can be built to open the U60 network interface in either Layer 2 or 
Layer 5 mode.  To open the interface in Layer 5 mode, change 
U50_OPEN_LAYER2 to U50_OPEN_LAYER5 in the following code:

static int u50_dev_open(struct net_device *dev) {
    struct u50_priv *priv = netdev_priv(dev);
    if (priv->tty == NULL)
        return -ENODEV;
    U50LinkStart(&priv->state, 0, SMPBAUD, U50_OPEN_LAYER2);
    flush_cancel(dev);
    
The U60 driver requires a unique and valid network device line discipline 
number.  By default, the U60 driver uses line discipline number 28 since 
28 is a valid but unassigned line discipline number for Linux kernel 3.8 
as used in the IzoT Router.  You can use a different line discipline number 
if 28 is not available or valid for your version of the Linux kernel.  The 
maximum line discipline number is typically defined by the NR_LDISCS 
constant.  For Linux kernel 3.8, NR_LDISCS is defined as 30.

To compile the U60 driver, you first need a compiled kernel source tree, 
including standard Linux support for a USB CDC/ACM class interface. The 
IzoT Router uses the BeagleBone kernel source tree available at 
https://github.com/RobertCNelson/linux-dev/releases.

Once a kernel tree has been compiled, you then run the make modules command 
in the kernel source tree and pass in the directory containing the U50Module 
source in the SUBDIRS environment variable and the directory of the kernel 
source in the KDIR environment variable.

Example:

KERN=/src/3.8.13-bone47/linux-dev-3.8.13-bone47/KERNEL
U50_DIR=/src/U50Module/
make -C $KERN KDIR=$KERN SUBDIRS=$U50_DIR ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- modules

The module will be built as u50.ko, which should then be placed in the 
/lib/modules/3.8.13-bone47/kernel/drivers/lon/ directory on the IzoT Router.

A udev rule file is required to install the driver.  For example, you 
can create a udev rule file named 90-liftd.rules in the /etc/udev/rules.d 
directory.  Following is an example rule for the U60:

SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0920", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5550", RUN+="/usr/bin/lonifd -d /dev/%k"

If you modified the line discipline number, you must specify the 
non-default line discipline number in the rule using the -l parameter.  
The following example rule includes the -l parameter with a non-standard 
value of 16 for the line discipline number:

SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0920", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5550", RUN+="/usr/bin/lonifd -l 16 -d /dev/%k"

You will also need to build the lonifd daemon.  Source code and a make 
file is also included with the U60 driver for the lonifd daemon.

Once you have built the driver and lonifd daemon, and you have created 
the udev rule file, you can install the driver in Linux using the insmod command.  

This will create a Linux network device.  If you create a single U60 
driver, the name will be /dev/lon0.  This will not be a character device 
as was typically used for classic LON drivers.  It will instead be a 
network device that you will access through a socket interface.  The 
benefit of a network device is that it can be easily used with the 
Linux IP stack for supporting LonTalk/IP, for example when communicating 
with the BACnet/IP, ICMP (for ping), or SNMP protocols over the U60.  

If the U60 driver is initialized correctly, you will see the network 
interface as one of the devices listed by the Linux ifconfig command.

You can bypass the IP stack to use the U60 driver as just a classic 
LON driver.  The following example code opens the U60 socket as a 
raw character device with a packet socket, bypassing the IP stack:
 
    int sockfd = socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, htons(0x8950));
 
    struct ifreq ifr = { 0 };
    size_t ifnamelen = strlen(ifname);
    memcpy(ifr.ifr_name, ifname, ifnamelen);
    if (ioctl(socket, SIOCGIFINDEX, &ifr) < 0) {
        return errno;
    }
 
    struct sockaddr_ll addr = { 0 };
    addr.sll_family = AF_PACKET;
    addr.sll_ifindex = ifr.ifr_ifindex;
 
    if (bind(socket, (struct sockaddr*) &addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_ll)) < 0) {
        return errno;
    }

Using this example code, you can read and write the sockd device using 
the same code used for other classic LON drivers.

Interface User's Guide for more information.
